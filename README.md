* Optimized SARIMA model with grid search and expanding window, achieving a Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) of lower than 16%. Utilized Facebook Prophet to train prediction model as a benchmark to compare against SARIMA model.
* Launched interactive time series dashboard with range slider using Plotly to compare prediction results.
